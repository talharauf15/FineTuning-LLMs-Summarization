# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Text Summarization

This repository contains the implementation of fine-tuning and evaluating various Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task of text summarization. It is part of the CS-4063 Natural Language Processing course (Fall 2024) Assignment 3.

## Objectives
The goal is to fine-tune pre-trained models and compare their performance on a text summarization task. The following models are included:
- **BERT**: Fine-tuned for extractive summarization to identify and extract the most relevant sentences.
- **GPT-2**: Fine-tuned for abstractive summarization, generating coherent summaries from input text.
- **Llama**: (Optional, as per assignment implementation).

## Features
- Implementation of fine-tuning processes using [Hugging Face's Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers) library.
- Evaluation of models using metrics such as training loss, ROUGE scores, and subjective summary quality.
- Visual comparison of sample summaries generated by each model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this assignment is publicly available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lusfernandotorres/text-summarization-with-large-language-models/input).

## Methodology
1. Fine-tuning:
   - Each model is fine-tuned on the dataset using frameworks like Hugging Face.
   - Extractive summarization for BERT and abstractive summarization for GPT-2.
   
2. Evaluation:
   - Training loss and other metrics (e.g., ROUGE scores) are reported.
   - Sample summaries are generated for qualitative comparison.
   
3. Comparison:
   - Summary quality, relevance, conciseness, and coherence are analyzed.
   - Metric-based and subjective comparisons highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

## Results
- Summaries generated by each model are included with sample input texts.
- Detailed evaluation metrics are documented.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/talharauf15/FineTuning-LLMs-Summarization.git
   ```
